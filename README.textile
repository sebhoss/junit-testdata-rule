h1. JUnit Testdata Rule "!https://secure.travis-ci.org/sebhoss/junit-testdata-rule.png!":http://travis-ci.org/sebhoss/junit-testdata-rule "!https://www.ohloh.net/p/junit-testdata-rule/widgets/project_thin_badge.gif!":https://www.ohloh.net/p/junit-testdata-rule/

p. JUnit "@TestRule@":https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Rules to load data into a database before a test runs.

p. Testdata can either specified on a per test basis, or with the help of "@ClassRule@":https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Rules#classrule for a whole class (which may be a JUnit Testsuite which contains several other classes). However the main audience of this module are projects which want/need specific "data for a single test":http://github.com/sebhoss/junit-testdata-rule/wiki/why. There are "several alternatives":http://github.com/sebhoss/junit-testdata-rule/wiki/alternatives for this module.

h2. Usage

bc.. 
  public class YourTestClass {

    @Rule
    public TestData testData = ...;

    @Test
    @Load("customers.sql")
    public void shouldSeeCustomersInDatabase() {
      // ...
    }

    @Test
    @Load("orders.sql")
    public void shouldSeeOrdersInDatabase() {
      // ...
    }

  }

h3. Supported file formats

* *.SQL* files for arbitrary SQL statements.
